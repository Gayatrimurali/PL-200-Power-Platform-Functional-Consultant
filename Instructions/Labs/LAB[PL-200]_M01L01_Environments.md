# Module 1 : Lab 1.1 - Create environments

## Scenario

In this lab, you create environments for use during the remainder of the labs.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will perform:

+ Task 1: Create development environment
+ Task 2: Create live environment

## Exercise 1 - Create environments

In this exercise, you will create a *Development* environment that you will do the majority of your lab work in and a *Live* environment to deploy solutions into.

**Note:** Depending on the browser that you are using, it is suggested that you disable any pop-up blockers that maybe enabled. This will allow pop-up windows to appear as they should.
